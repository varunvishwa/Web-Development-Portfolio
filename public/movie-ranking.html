<h1>The Best</h1>
<h2>These are the top ten best movies I have ever seen.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A perfect combination of emotion, sci-fi, thrill, love, suspense and oh my, that mesmerising soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Brillianty executed thriller with one of the best, if not the greatest plot twists of all time.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Hands down, the best Batman movie ever. A dark and emotionally rousing portrayal of the superhero, with Hans Zimmer's magic sprayed all over it.</p>
